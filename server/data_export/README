This folder contains utilities for exporting data to csv format. They do not need a full Django server to run. 

For running in standalone mode in a fresh install, begin by creating a new Python environment and installing the heartsteps python requirements from server/requirements.txt using pip install -r requirements.txt. Note that these requirements will not install with conda due to package versions not being available.

To configure for development mode, copy an export.json file to this directory and run local_setup.sh to build an empty sqllite database and populate it with data.

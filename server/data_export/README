This folder contains utilities for exporting data to csv format. They do not need a full Django server to run. The steps needed to setup a development environment are as follows:

1) Install Docker Desktop (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2) From the root of the heartsteps repo, run "docker-compose run server bash". This will build the docker file for the server, run it, and then start a bash session. The root of this repository on the host is mounted as /server in the container.
3) On the host, copy a data export file to this directory.
4) In the Docker container, run "local_setup.sh" to create an empty database and import an export.json file. This will create an sqlite database in this directory.
5) Run "python run_export.py" to export data. Will create a directory "output" under this directory containing user data directories.
